# CPP-Baugh-RPG-Character-Creator-Modified
The CPP Baugh RPG Character Creator Modified is built on a class project I did for Dr. John P. Baugh’s ‘The Complete C++ Developer Course’ (Udemy).  This class project builds on a number of important principles of object-oriented programming, which includes inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  Parent-child class relations and pure virtual functions are utilized in this project.

The criteria for the original project has been modified to include character classes and character races that fit with a more traditional ‘old school’ pencil-and-paper.  Also, random hit points and magic points have been incorporated into the generator (the original project provides ‘flat values’ for these statistics).

I am planning to use this project as a template for future C++ RPG Character Generators.
